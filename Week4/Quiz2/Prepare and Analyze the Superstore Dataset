Project Overview
Great work getting to this point! You have only one final graded task to complete before finishing the course. 
In this project, you'll be working with a very familiar dataset â€” the Superstore dataset.

In the next course of this certificate, you'll make your way through the last two phases.

This project will be in the form of a graded assessment. You will first connect to the Superstore dataset in Tableau. From there, you'll be prompted to perform various tasks and will be asked follow-up questions, which will be auto-graded.

If you are unsure about how to perform any of the tasks in the project, you are encouraged to return to the course to review any concepts you might have missed.
